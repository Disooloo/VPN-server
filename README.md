# Here is a simple code to create a VPN server in Python using the tunTap library

```
This code creates a TUN interface, configures the IP address and network mask for this interface, creates a socket and starts receiving incoming packets on port 1194. Incoming packets are sent to the TUN interface for further processing. This is a very simple example and most likely you will have to extend it to meet your VPN server needs.
